# Flights Delay
## by Gilvan Reis


## Dataset

The dataset has 20,932 operation records grouped by a specific carrier at an airport during one month of the year. The dataset has 23 characteristics, the majority being numeric and some based on the number of delayed flights (`arr_del15`). A flight is considered to be delayed when the departure is at least 15 minutes later than expected. The records are limited to the U.S. area during 2019.


## Summary of Findings

- The main cause of delays (36.9%) is due to the delay of a previous flight on the same aircraft, with delays due to safety problems being very rare (0.2%).
- June is the month with the most delays and September, the least.
- Frontier, ExpressJet, and JetBlue are the carriers that have the highest proportion of delayed flights, while Hawaiian and Delta have the lowest.
- Based on the data alone, I was able to infer that ExpressJet Airlines Inc. was renamed to ExpressJet Airlines LLC in March 2019.
- Normally, every carrier has a significant increase in delayed flights during June.
- Hawaiian Airlines has a very consistent and low proportion of delayed flights throughout the year, while other companies (such as Endeavor Air) have a very variable proportion of delayed flights.
- 6 of the 17 carriers in the dataset have the main cause of delay due to the National Aviation System (for example, non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control) throughout the year, which are out of control from the carrier.
- Even though Hawaiian Airlines has the lowest proportion of delayed flights, the main cause of the delay are problems related to the carrier's operation, indicating that it should be improved. This issue is reinforced in the comparison with other operators, presenting a significant difference.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Title: Hawaiian Airlines flight delay analysis
- The study was conducted on 20,932 operating records from 17 carriers limited to the US area during 2019. A flight is considered to be delayed when it departs at least 15 minutes later than expected.
- The main cause of delays (36.9%) is due to a previous flight with the same aircraft being delayed. Delays due to security problems are very rare (0.2%).
- Hawaiian Airlines has the lowest proportion of delayed flights (0.11%) when compared to other carriers.
- Hawaiian Airlines has a very low and consistent proportion of delayed flights throughout the year, with February being the month with the highest proportion of delayed flights.
- However, when comparing the main cause of delays in each carrier, we can observe different behavior on Hawaiian Airlines. The main cause of its delays is due to carrier problems (for example, maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).
- When looking at the proportion of carrier problems in each carrier, we can see that Hawaiian Airlines differs from the others with a much higher proportion, indicating that there is an opportunity for improvement in this area for the company.
